Supercharge your canvas LMS experience because Canvas isn't doing better


## Fast File Navigation/Viewer
Got irritated by the countless number of times I had to navigate through the file system in Canvas just to find a file and the search UI isn't helping. 
So considering this, I've added a quick search feature to each module card on the dashboard.
1. Search by file keywords/name
2. Filter by folder

## Microsoft To-Do List Integration
Another feature included is the integration of quick task adding to Microsoft To-Do List App via MS Graph API (I frequently use this app to keep myself from f**ing up)
1. Automatic deadline identification and adding
2. Supports multi-list (Selection of list available in extension settings)
